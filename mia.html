		<h2>Favorite Hobbies</h2>
		<p>  I really love to do circus arts, dance, regular sketching, animation, and sailing. 
I have been partaking in the arts for quite a while. Dance, art, animation, instruments, and circus arts.
<p> I have been doing dance since I was really little. My first dance performance was so memorable
I did ballet and i had a red and gold tutu, I was no older than 5 years at the time. 
This was the start of my journey in the arts.
  When i was in elementery school, I got the hottest new consol around, the Wii. Since I loved to dance, my parent would always buy the latest just dance disk every christmas for me. I got lead role for the christmas play. I continued on with dance my whole life. I also love the circus arts. </p>
