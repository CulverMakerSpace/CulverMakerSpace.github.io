			<h2>Favorite Althele</h2>

				Roger Federer is Swiss tennis player who 
				dominated the sport in the early 21st century. 
				He won a record eight Wimbledon titles, 
				and in 2018 he became the first player to 
				claim 20 Grand Slam menâ€™s singles titles.</p>
			<h2>Favorite Song</h2>
				<p>My favorite song is Bones by Imagine Dragons.
				Bones is a very catchy and energetic song that 
				makes you wan to dance and sing along.</p>
			<h2>Favorite Food</h2>
				<p>My favorite food is ice cream. Ice cream is 
				is frozen so it is really good for cooling down on 
				a hot summer day. The taste of ice cream is also
				very creamy and soothing. There are also many different 
				flavors to try and so you can always try something new.</p>
